# pix2pix-pv
Assessing generalization of pix2pix style transfer GAN for semantic segmentation of PV panels from aerial imagery

## Problem statement
We don't have enough training datasets from developing countries. Models that generalize better can be more helpful in global development.

## Proposal
Generalization of deep learning models are found to have improved because of using GAN generated images as training images. Using a Conditional GAN may improve generalization performance. 

## What we do
We use Pix2Pix, a supervised learning CGAN that can be used for semantic segmentation by framing it as a style transfer problem. We assess the generalization performance of Pix2Pix.
